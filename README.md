### Hello! I'm Chris Gorman
#### Data Analyst
I am a Data Analyst with Background in Healthcare.  I attended Nashville Software School where I received my Data Analyst Certificate.  The transition from healthcare to data analysts was a bit scary at first.  However,  I have found a great passion in this new field and I am very excited to continue broadening my horizons!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on My Capstone Project
  -  My Capstone focuses on automating the private dining data collection and visualization of a small growing restaurant group.  This is a bit of a passion project of mine and I will continue to work and implement new ideas weekly.
